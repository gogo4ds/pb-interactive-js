# JavaScript Language
# Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters
The **programming language** defines a set of rules (syntax)

Languages are either **compiled** (like Java, C#, C++) or **interpreted** (like JavaScript and Python)

The **compiler** translates programming code to **machine code**

* During the compilation, it finds syntax errors

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line

* It finds syntax errors at runtime

# The JavaScript Language
**JavaScript** is prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language

* Supports imperative, functional and object-oriented programming

Used both on the **client-side** (in the Web browser) andon the server-side (in Node.js)

Good choice for **beginners**

* Easy syntax, easy to read, **easy to learn**
* Big developer **community**, many jobs
* Lots of **resources**: books, lessons, courses

# JavaScript Execution
JavaScript is a **high-level**, **dynamic**, **interpreted language**

A program in JS is written in text format (**source code**)

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line
